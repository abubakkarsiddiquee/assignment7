       <li><h3>What's the difference of map,filter,forEach,find ?</h3> <br>
         Answer :  .forEach(), is used to execute the same code on every element in an array but does not change the array and it returns undefined.
         <br>.map() executes the same code on every element in an array and returns a new array with the updated elements.<br>
         .filter() checks every element in an array to see if it meets a certain criteria and returns a new array with the elements that return truthy for the criteria.<br>
         . find() locates a specific entry by a predicate and returns it.  </li> 
        <li><h3>What's the difference between local,session,cookies storage ? </h3><br>
        Answer : Local storage is useful for storing data that the user will need to access later, such as offline data. Session storage is a great way to improve the performance of your web applications. Cookies are a good choice for storing data that should not be persisted for a long time, such as session IDs.</li>
        <li><h3> What is Event loop ?</h3> <br>
        Answer : Event loop in JavaScript is a mechanism through which the 'calls waiting for execution' in the callback queue/job queue can be put on the call stack. For any event from the callback queue/job queue to come to call stack, the call stack will have to be empty.</li>
